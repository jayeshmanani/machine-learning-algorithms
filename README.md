# Machine Learning Algorithms
Here in this repo I have demonstrated the implementation of the various machine learning algorithms which are used for achieving various tasks with some example.

# 1. KNN Algorithm (K Nearest Neighbor algorithm) 
This is lazy loading algorithm. Which is used for clustering the dataset based on nearest neighbours. K stands for number of nearest nodes we are taken into account which we use for clustering the particular value according to lowest distance from the no. of nodes. It will be also use for many other applications too. We can use it for classification task too. 

I have demonstated the classification task on IRIS dataset using the KNN algorithm. Step by step procedure was written in the colab notebook here --> https://github.com/jayeshmanani/machine-learning-algorithms/blob/master/1.KNN_Algorithm_For_IRIS_Dataset.ipynb

You also can achieve the classification task using the same code. We can do a lot more using this algorithms. this also can be used in the recommendation engine too for recommending the similar items too.
